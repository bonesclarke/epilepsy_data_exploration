"Age-Related Seizure Network Maturation and Implications for Gene Therapy Timing Windows"

The Research Question
"Do focal seizure propagation patterns differ systematically between pediatric and adult patients, and could these differences inform optimal timing windows for gene therapy interventions?"

Why This Matters for Gene Therapy
Research has shown that genetic interventions may have temporally narrow windows of efficacy, after (or before) which little amelioration of the disease phenotype may be seen. This may be especially important for therapies targeting ion channels expressed only transiently in development Are Genetic Therapies for Epilepsy Ready for the Clinic? - James S. Street, Yichen Qiu, Gabriele Lignani, 2023.
Your combined dataset gives you a unique advantage because:

CHB-MIT: Pediatric focal epilepsy (developing brains)
Siena: Adult focal epilepsy (mature brains)
Gene therapy relevance: Understanding when brain networks are most modifiable

What You'd Analyze (Reproving Known Concepts)

Seizure Propagation Speed: Compare how quickly seizures spread across brain regions in children vs adults
Network Connectivity Patterns: Analyze which brain regions are most involved in seizure networks at different ages
Pre-ictal Signal Characteristics: Look for age-related differences in the lead-up to seizures


First problem to solve: How quickly do seizures spread across brain regions?


Second problem to solve: What brain regions are most involved in seizure networks?
