Differentiate between spikes and shar wave morphology differences

1. Spike
Duration: < 70 milliseconds
Shape: Very steep rise and fall, narrow and pointed
Appearance: Looks like a needle or a lightning bolt
Clinical Relevance: Often associated with epilepsy, especially focal epilepsy
Example Use: Seen in interictal epileptiform discharges (IEDs)

2. Sharp Wave
Duration: 70â€“200 milliseconds
Shape: Still pointed, but broader and less steep than a spike
Appearance: More like a hill with a sharp peak
Clinical Relevance: Also associated with epileptiform activity, but may be seen in slower seizure types or diffuse abnormalities

How to Tell the Difference
Here are some ways to distinguish between true seizure activity and artifact:

Feature	Seizure Activity	Artifact
Location	Can involve multiple regions, not just frontal	Mostly frontal (Fp1/Fp2)
Morphology	Sharp waves, spikes, rhythmic discharges	Irregular, slow waves or high-frequency bursts
Duration	Lasts seconds to minutes, often stereotyped	Brief, inconsistent
Clinical Correlation	Matches observed behavior (e.g., eye fluttering, loss of awareness)	No clinical signs or unrelated movements
Video-EEG	Shows eye fluttering as part of seizure	Shows blinking or movement unrelated to seizure
